<b>Requirements (Instruments, Chemicals & Other): </b><br>

● Ostwald viscometer<br>
● Stopwatch or timer<br>
● Beakers<br>
● Pipette or dropper<br>
● Thermometer (±0.5°C)<br>
● Water bath (25°C)<br>
● Suction bulb or rubber tubing<br>
● Distilled water<br>
● Test liquid (e.g., glycerin, alcohol)<br>
● Density bottle<br>
● Measuring cylinders (25 mL, 50 mL)<br>
● Spatula<br>
● Tissue paper or cotton<br>
● Data recording sheets<br>
● Calculator or computer for analysis<br>

<b>Procedure:</b><br> 

● Clean and dry the viscometer thoroughly before use.<br>
● Fill the viscometer with distilled water up to the mark using a pipette.<br>
● Immerse the viscometer in a constant temperature water bath (25°C) for 5 minutes.<br>
● Using a suction bulb, draw the water above the upper mark.<br>
● Start the stopwatch as the liquid crosses the upper mark and stop when it reaches the lower mark — record as t₂.<br>
● Repeat three times and take the mean value.<br>
● Empty and rinse the viscometer with the test liquid.<br>
● Repeat steps 2–6 with the test liquid to record t₁.<br>
● Measure the densities ρ₁ (test liquid) and ρ₂ (water) using a density bottle.<br>
● Calculate the relative and absolute viscosities using the formulas provided.
