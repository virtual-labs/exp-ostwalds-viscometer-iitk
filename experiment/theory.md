Viscosity is a measure of a fluid’s internal resistance to flow. It represents the frictional force that resists motion between adjacent layers of a liquid.
The Ostwald viscometer operates on the principle of Poiseuille’s Law, which states that the rate of flow of a liquid through a capillary tube is directly proportional to the pressure and the fourth power of the radius, and inversely proportional to the viscosity and length of the tube.<br>

η₁ / η₂ = (ρ₁ t₁) / (ρ₂ t₂)<br>
Where:<br>
η₁ = Viscosity of the test liquid<br>
η₂ = Viscosity of water<br>
ρ₁ = Density of the test liquid<br>
ρ₂ = Density of water<br>
t₁ = Flow time of the test liquid<br>
t₂ = Flow time of water<br><br>
If the density of both liquids is known, the absolute viscosity (η₁) of the given liquid can be determined using:<br>
η₁ = η₂ × (ρ₁ t₁) / (ρ₂ t₂)<br><br>
The viscosity of water at 25°C is approximately 0.89 cP. Temperature plays a critical role — hence the viscometer must be immersed in a constant-temperature water bath to maintain accuracy.
