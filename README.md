### About the Experiment 

Ostwald Viscometry is simple method for the measurement of viscosity in which viscosity of a liquid is measured by comparing the viscosity of an unknown liquid with that of the known liquid. In this method, viscosity of a liquid is measured by comparing the flow times of two liquids of equal volume using Ostwald viscometer. Usually the reference liquid is water.
